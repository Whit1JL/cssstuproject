This project was created by Micah, Dan, and Jessica. We are students in the Northwestern/Triology bootcamp where we are learning full stack developer skills. In this particular project, we created a CSS Cheatsheet utilizing wireframe and other amazing functions found only in CSS. We also utilized media query and flexbox to make the page responsive.
